#summary YouTube + App Engine Codelab

= Introduction =

This codelab will take you through the basics of using the Google Data Python Client Library with App Engine. It will go from fetching feeds, to authentication, to uploading a video to YouTube. All code samples in this codelab can be found [http://code.google.com/p/hello-youtube/source/browse here].

= Hello App Engine =

Here's a crash course in App Engine. For more detailed documentation, refer to the [http://code.google.com/appengine App Engine docs]. We're assuming all of your project files are in a folder named `Codelab`.

  # Assuming you've downloaded and installed the SDK, start up your development webserver: `dev_appserver.py /path_to_project/Codelab/`
  # Go to http://localhost:8080 to check it out.
