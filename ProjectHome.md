# Introduction #

This codelab will take you through the basics of using the Google Data Python Client Library with App Engine. It will go from fetching feeds, to authentication, to uploading a video to YouTube. All code samples in this codelab can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/hello-youtube/source/browse).

# Before We Start #

Here are the things you'll need:
  * Knowledge of [Python](http://python.org)
  * [Python 2.5](http://python.org/download/) on your local machine
  * [App Engine SDK](http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html)
  * App Engine Account - TODO: Add live link once it's open
  * YouTube [Developer Key](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/)
  * YouTube [Account](http://youtube.com/signup) (preferably a test account with a private video uploaded to test authenticated feeds)

Please also hop into our IRC channel if you feel so inclined:

  * irc.freenode.net port 6667
  * #youtubecodelab

If you don't have a IRC client installed, there are web-based clients:
